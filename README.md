## About
This is the learning product for the 2020 El Dorado Fire Entrapment Learning Review (https://lessons.fs2c.usda.gov/incident/el-dorado-fire-fatality-2020):
- Utilizes AFrame to display the concept of a virtual "museum" of the event.
- Each room of the building is focused on a specific area of the report, along with a to-scale display of the dozer line where the fatality occured.
- The terrain and fuel models used for the dozer line are generated with FastFuels ( https://github.com/silvxlabs/fastfuels-core ), manually modified to "fit" the building and remove vegetation near the dozer line.
- The report is embedded throughout the scene in 19 narrated "stands".
- 6 additional "stands" of the narrated Organizational Learning Report are embedded
- Images, videos linked in the report are built into the scene, along with additional content

## History
- The El Dorado Learning Review Team requested an innovative, experiential learning product for release with the report.
- A small team was organized that developed the concept of a virtual learning product using 3D tools with the capacity for optional consumption in Virtual Reality.
- A desired design element/goal was that the product could be updated over time.
- The learning product was originally constructed and deployed in Mozilla Hubs in mid-late 2021, with assets served from government cloud services (AWS).
- Interagency Hotshot Crews reported spending up to a whole day (8 hours) using the product during Critical Training.
- Government cloud services became unavailable in 2023, forcing the product to be unavailable.
- Mozilla ended support for Hubs in May, 2024. (https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/end-support-mozilla-hubs)
- In 2024, this repo was initiated to display proof of concept, and honor the fallen through learning.

For Charlie.
